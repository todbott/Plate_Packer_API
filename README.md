# API endpoint for controlling warehouse robots

Mitsubishi is starting a spinoff company (Aukai) in Japan recently (writing this in March of 2022), and I was lucky enough to be considered as a potential team member.  As part of my 2nd technical interview, I was asked to create the code in this repository.  Sadly, in the end, I was deemed 'not able to hit the ground running,' and was eliminated from the pool of candidates.

Just the same, I loved making this API endpoint--even deployed it on GKE in a cluster (now deactivated).  Thanks, Aukai!
